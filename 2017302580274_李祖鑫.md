## P2

### a.

2^8 = 256 linksã€‚Different virutal circuits must have different links.

### b

Choosing a free VC number from central node. In this case, the maximum connections in the network will be limited to 256

### c

Each router can chooses a free VC number, and replacing the packet`s VC number with this number.


## P6
The term 'oriented' means like.Transport service maintain connection state, while the router does not need to keep the connection. Connection services in network layer means each router on the link should keep the connection.


## P11

for 8 bit, prefix and the number is given by

            00 -> n<=00111111 

            010 -> n<=010111111

            011 -> n<=011111111

            10 -> n<= 10111111

            11 -> n <= 11111111

sorted by the longest prefix 

then
```
