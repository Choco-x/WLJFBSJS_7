# Homework 7

### Question 1

> **P5.** Consider a datagram network using 32-bit host addresses. Suppose a router has four links, numbered 0 through 3, and packets are to be forwarded to the link interfaces as follows:

| Destination Address Range | Link Interface |
| -- | -- |
| 11100000 00000000 00000000 00000000 through 11100000 00111111 11111111 11111111 | 0 |
| 11100000 01000000 00000000 00000000 through 11100000 01000000 11111111 11111111 | 1 |
| 11100000 01000001 00000000 00000000 through 11100001 01111111 11111111 11111111 | 2 |
| otherwise | 3 |

> **a.** Provide a forwarding table that has five entries, uses longest prefix matching, and forwards packets to the correct link interfaces.

>> **My Answer:** Forwarding table using longest prefix matching is as follows:

| Prefix | Link Interface |
| -- | -- |
| 11100000 00 | 0 |
| 11100000 01000000 | 1 |
| 1110000 | 2 |
| 11100001 1 | 3 |
| otherwise | 3 |

> **b.** Describe how your forwarding table determines the appropriate link interface for datagrams with destination addresses:
> 11001000 10010001 01010001 01010101
> 11100001 01000000 11000011 00111100
> 11100001 10000000 00010001 01110111

>> **My Answer:** 

| Destination Address | Matched Prefix | Appropriate Link Interface |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 11001000 10010001 01010001 01010101 | None | 3 |
| 11100001 01000000 11000011 00111100 | 1110000 | 2 |
| 11100001 10000000 00010001 01110111 | 1110000 (7 bits), 11100001 1 (9 bits) | 3 |

### Question 2

> **P12.** Consider the topology shown in Figure 1. Denote the three subnets with hosts (starting clockwise at 12:00) as Networks A, B, and C. Denote the subnets without hosts as Networks D, E, and F.

<center>Figure 1</center>

> **a.** Assign network addresses to each of these six subnets, with the following constraints: All addresses must be allocated from 214.97.254/23; Subnet A should have enough addresses to support 250 interfaces; Subnet B should have enough addresses to support 120 interfaces; and Subnet C should have enough addresses to support 120 interfaces. Of course, subnets D, E and F should each be able to support two interfaces. For each subnet, the assignment should take the form a.b.c.d/x or a.b.c.d/x â€“ e.f.g.h/y.

>> **My Answer:**

| Subnet | Assignment |
| -- | -- |
| A | 214.97.254/24 (256 Addresses) |
| B | 214.97.255.0/25 - 214.97.255.0/30 (128-4=124 Addresses) |
| C | 214.97.255.128/25 - 214.97.255.128/31 (128-2=126 Addresses) |
| D | 214.97.255.0/31 (2 Addresses) |
| E | 214.97.255.2/31 (2 Addresses) |
| F | 214.97.255.128/31 (2 Addresses) |

> **b.** Using your answer to part (a), provide the forwarding tables (using longest prefix matching) for each of the three routers.

>> **My Answer:**

Denote the three routers (starting clockwise at 12:00) as Router 1, 2, and 3. 

Forwarding Table for Router 1:

| Prefix | Link Interface |
| -- | -- |
| 11010110 01100001 11111110 | A |
| 11010110 01100001 11111111 0000000 | D |
| 11010110 01100001 11111111 1000000 | F |

Forwarding Table for Router 2:

| Prefix | Link Interface |
| -- | -- |
| 11010110 01100001 11111111 0 | B |
| 11010110 01100001 11111111 0000000 | D |
| 11010110 01100001 11111111 0000001 | E |

Forwarding Table for Router 3:

| Prefix | Link Interface |
| -- | -- |
| 11010110 01100001 11111111 1 | C |
| 11010110 01100001 11111111 0000001 | E |
| 11010110 01100001 11111111 1000000 | F |

### Question 3

> **P16.** Consider the network setup in Figure 2. Suppose that the ISP instead assigns the router the address 24.34.112.235 and that the network address of the home network is 192.168.1/24.

| Host 1 | 192.168.1.1 |
| Host 2 | 192.168.1.2 |
| Host 3 | 192.168.1.3 |
| Router | 192.168.1.4 |

> **b.** Suppose each host has two ongoing TCP connections, all to port 80 at host 128.119.40.86. Provide the six corresponding entries in the NAT translation table.
