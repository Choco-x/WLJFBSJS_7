### p2
a. because they use a shared bus, these 2 packets can't be transmitted at one shared bus. We can transmitted one packet at a time only.

b.No, although they use memory exchange, they can't be transmitted at the same time. You can only do read/write memory at one time.

c.No, you have to send these 2 packets at the same ouput bus, which is impossible.

### p5
a.	
| prefix-matching | port number | 
| ------ | ------ |
| 11100000 00 | 0 |
| 11100000 01000000 | 1 |
| 1110000 | 2 |
| 11100001 1| 3 |
| else | 3 |

b. the first address will be matched to the port 3,  the sencond address will be matched to the port 2, the last address will be matched to the port 3.

### p15
the data should occupy 1500-40=1460 bytes. If we want to send a 5MB Mp3 file we need to 5MB/1460B=3425, because this operation has a remainder, so the last datagram will be 1000 bytes, others will all be 1500 bytes.
