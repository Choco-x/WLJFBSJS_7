### P5: Answer
a. 
| Prefix Match        | Link Interface |
| ------------------- | -------------- |
| 1110 0000 00        | 0              |
| 1110 0000 0100 0000 | 1              |
| 1110 000            | 2              |
| 1110 0001 1         | 3              |
| otherwise           | 3              |
  
b.   
Prefix match for first address is 5th entry: link interface 3.  
Prefix match for second address is 3nd entry: link interface 2.  
Prefix match for third address is 4th entry: link interface 3.  
  
    
### P6: Answer
| Destination Address Range | Link Interface |
| ------------------------- | -------------- |
| 00000000 through 00111111 |       0        |
| 01000000 through 01011111 |       1        |
| 01100000 through 01111111 |       2        |
| 10000000 through 10111111 |       2        |
| 11000000 through 11111111 |       3        |  

The number of addresses for interface 0 is 2<sup>6</sup> = 64.  
The number of addresses for interface 1 is 2<sup>5</sup> = 32.  
The number of addresses for interface 2 is 2<sup>6</sup> + 2<sup>5</sup> = 96.  
The number of addresses for interface 3 is 2<sup>6</sup> = 64.
