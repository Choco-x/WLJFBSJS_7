﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿# Assignment 7###Problem 4  The minimal number of time slots needed is 3. The scheduling is as follows. Slot 1: send X in top input queue, send Y in middle input queue.    Slot 2: send X in middle input queue, send Y in bottom input queue Slot 3: send Z in bottom input queue.   Largest number of slots is still 3. Actually, based on the assumption that a non-empty input queue is never idle, we see that the first time slot always consists of sending X in the top input queue and Y in either middle or bottom input queue, and in the second time slot, we can always send two more datagram, and the last datagram can be sent in third time slot.  NOTE: Actually, if the first datagram in the bottom input queue is X, then the worst case would require 4 time slots.  ###Problem 5 a) Prefix Match    Link Interface 11100000  00        011100000  01000000              1 1110000               2 11100001  1         3    b)   Prefix match for first address is 5th entry: link interface 3       Prefix match for second address is 3nd  entry: link interface 2       Prefix match for third address is 4th  entry: link interface 3 ###Problem 11  Any IP address in range 128.119.40.128 to 128.119.40.191  Four equal size subnets: 128.119.40.64/28, 128.119.40.80/28, 128.119.40.96/28, 128.119.40.112/28
