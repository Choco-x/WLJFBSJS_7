## T2:

a) No, you can only transmit one packet at a time over a shared bus.
b) No, as discussed in the text, only one memory read/write can be done at a time over
the shared system bus.
c) No, in this case the two packets would have to be sent over the same output bus at the
same time, which is not possible.

## T3:

a) (n-1)D
b) (n-1)D
c) 0

## T4:

The minimal number of time slots needed is 3. The scheduling is as follows.
Slot 1: send X in top input queue, send Y in middle input queue.
Slot 2: send X in middle input queue, send Y in bottom input queue
Slot 3: send Z in bottom input queue.
Largest number of slots is still 3. Actually, based on the assumption that a non-empty input queue
is never idle, we see that the first time slot always consists of sending X in the top input queue
and Y in either middle or bottom input queue, and in the second time slot, we can always send
two more datagram, and the last datagram can be sent in third time slot.
NOTE: Actually, if the first datagram in the bottom input queue is X, then the worst case would
require 4 time slots.
