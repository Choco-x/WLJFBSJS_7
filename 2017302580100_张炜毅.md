The minimum number of time slots required is 3, which is scheduled as follows.

Slot 1: send X in the top input queue and Y in the middle input queue.

Slot 2: send X in the middle input queue, y in the bottom input queue,

Slot 3: send Z in the bottom input queue.

In fact, based on the assumption that a non empty input queue is never idle, the first slot always consists of sending X in the top input queue and sending y in the middle or bottom input queue, while in the second slot, we can always send two more datagrams, and the last datagram can be sent in the third time slot.
