## Homework 7

#### P4

1. At least 3. The switch order can be [(1,X),(3,Y)], [(2,Y),(3,Z)], [(2,X)], and there are several possible orders.
(1,2,3 represent the index of input port)

2. At most 3. Based on the assumption that the non-null input queue will not be free of work,
In the given situation, the choice of the first transmitted Y packet will not affect the basic time consumption, which is 3.

#### P5
a.

Destination Address Range | Link interface
------------ | -------------
11100000 00****** ******** ******** | 0
11100000 01000000 ******** ******** | 1
11100000 ******** ******** ******** | 2
11100001 0******* ******** ******** | 2
otherwise | 3

b. The first and third address match prefix of the last entry, so the output port should be 3. The second address matches the 
prefix of the fourth entry, so the output port should be 2.

#### P14
The data load of each datagram is limited within 680B, for the head length of IP datagram is 20B. So there will be ⌈2400B/680B⌉=4 fragments generated. The field values are listed:

length=700 identifier=422 flag=1 offset=0

length=700 identifier=422 flag=1 offset=85

length=700 identifier=422 flag=1 offset=170

length=380 identifier=422 flag=0 offset=255
