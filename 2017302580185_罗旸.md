# Homework 7

**P4**

>The minimal number of time slots needed is 3:
>
>Slot 1: send X in top input queue, send Y in middle input queue.
>
>Slot 2: send X in middle input queue, send Y in bottom input queue
>
>Slot 3: send Z in bottom input queue.

>The number of time slots is still 3.

>Based on the assumption that the non-null input queue will not be free of work, at the first time slot we can send X in top input queue and Y in another two input queues. And the second time send two more datagram, and the left one will be sent at last.

>b. The first destination address match the **last** Prefix Match, so the link interface is 3.
>
>The second destination address match the **third** Prefix Match, so the link interface is 2.
>
>The third destination address match the **fourth** Prefix Match, so the link interface is 3.

>Assume the data is carried in TCP segments, with each TCP segment having 20 bytes of header. Then each datagram can carry 1500-40=1460 bytes of the MP3 file. Then
>$$
>required\ datagrams = \frac{5*10^6}{1460}= 3424\ .....\ 960
>$$
>So the number of required datagrams is 3425. And the last datagram will be 960+40 = 1000 bytes.
