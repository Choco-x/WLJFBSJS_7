## Problem 2

a) No, only one packet can be transmitted  at a time over a shared bus.

b)No, only one action(read/write) can be done at a time over a shared bus.

c)No, in this case the two packets would have to be sent over the same output bus at the same time, obviously, it's impossible.

## Problem 3

a)(n-1)D

b)(n-1)D

c)0

## Problem5

b)

From the table listed above.

Prefix match for first address is 5<sup>th</sup> entry: link interface 3

for second address is 3<sup>th</sup> entry: link interface 2

for third address is 4<sup>th</sup> entry: link interface 3
