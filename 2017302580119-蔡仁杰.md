### P6: Answer
| Destination Address Range | Link Interface |
| ------------------------- | -------------- |
| 00000000 through 00111111 |       0        |
| 01000000 through 01011111 |       1        
| 01100000 through 01111111 |       2        |
| 10000000 through 10111111 |       2        |
| 11000000 through 11111111 |       3        |  

The number of addresses for interface 0 is 2<sup>6</sup> = 64.  

The number of addresses for interface 1 is 2<sup>5</sup> = 32.  

The number of addresses for interface 2 is 2<sup>6</sup> + 2<sup>5</sup> = 96.  

The number of addresses for interface 3 is 2<sup>6</sup> = 64.
